# Changelog

This file records user-visible language, framework, and tooling changes. It is
not a milestone checklist; the repository test suites and CI are the source of
truth for acceptance status.

## 0.10.0-dev — Clarity Reset

Breaking language changes:

- Named arguments use `name=value`; `null` is the only ordinary empty value.
- Classes use body fields and one explicit `constructor(...)` declaration.
- Optional chaining follows JavaScript one hop at a time.
- `List`, `Set`, and `Map` expose one small, consistent API without legacy
  aliases.
- `match` supports literals, enum members, type patterns, bindings, and guards.
- JSX branching uses ordinary expressions and control flow.
- Look uses CSS property names, explicit string values, named arguments, and
  explicit `before look` / `after look` unsafe CSS ordering.

Compiler and framework changes:

- Types now have a structured syntax tree and stable semantic identity.
- Mutable collections and writable structures are invariant.
- Reactive reference state cannot silently escape through aliases, nested
  mutation, component props, ordinary calls, or returns; copy and reassign is
  the explicit update model.
- Web JSX and Look participate in the Core lexical stream through the Web
  extension instead of being captured as opaque source blocks.
- JavaScript generation uses structured nodes with nested source-map positions.
- Actions retain observable pending/error state while preserving normal Promise
  rejection semantics.
- Assignments check the declared location type, invalidate stale optional facts,
  and lower as true JavaScript assignment targets without read-side null
  normalization.
- Short-circuit conditions and `while` bodies share optional narrowing, while
  complete source spans keep nested lowering hints from colliding.

Tooling and documentation changes:

- The formatter is syntax-aware and idempotent across Core, JSX, and Look.
- The language server diagnoses and repairs common JavaScript and Python
  spellings directly.
- README, reference documents, templates, real applications, and the
  VelarScript website use the same 0.10 contract.
- CI extracts and compiles documentation and website examples.

## 0.1 through 0.9 — Pre-release development

These development lines established the compiler, CLI, standard modules, Web
framework, package boundary, browser tests, Workbench integration contract, and
static deployment pipeline. Their experimental syntax is superseded by 0.10
and is intentionally not retained as compatibility surface. Detailed history
remains available in Git.
