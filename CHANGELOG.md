# Changelog

This file records user-visible language, framework, and tooling changes. It is
not a milestone checklist; the repository test suites and CI are the source of
truth for acceptance status.

## 0.10.0-dev — Clarity Reset

Breaking language changes:

- Named arguments use `name=value`; `null` is the only ordinary empty value.
- Classes use body fields and one explicit `constructor(...)` declaration.
- Optional chaining follows JavaScript one hop at a time.
- `List`, `Set`, and `Map` expose one small, consistent API without legacy
  aliases.
- `match` supports literals, enum members, type patterns, bindings, and guards.
- JSX branching uses ordinary expressions and control flow.
- Look uses CSS property names, explicit string values, named arguments, and
  explicit `before look` / `after look` unsafe CSS ordering.

Compiler and framework changes:

- Types now have a structured syntax tree and stable semantic identity.
- Mutable collections and writable structures are invariant.
- Reactive reference state cannot silently escape through aliases, nested
  mutation, component props, ordinary calls, or returns; copy and reassign is
  the explicit update model.
- Web JSX and Look participate in the Core lexical stream through the Web
  extension instead of being captured as opaque source blocks.
- JavaScript generation uses structured nodes with nested source-map positions.
- Actions retain observable pending/error state while preserving normal Promise
  rejection semantics.
- Assignments check the declared location type, invalidate stale optional facts,
  and lower as true JavaScript assignment targets without read-side null
  normalization.
- Short-circuit conditions and `while` bodies share optional narrowing, while
  complete source spans keep nested lowering hints from colliding.
- Mutually exclusive branches, `match` cases, terminating loops, and
  unreachable tails now merge flow facts by reachable path. Match guards narrow
  their body, and ordinary calls invalidate mutable or aliased facts unless the
  checked value was first saved in a local `const`. Getter and safe-JavaScript
  property reads, plus resumed code after `await`, follow the same effect
  boundary.
- Continuing branches now retain facts established on every path;
  `try`/`catch`/`finally`, match guard fallthrough, aliased member writes,
  JavaScript setters, object f-string coercion, and component JSX evaluation all
  follow emitted execution order instead of sharing or guessing flow state.
- Safe-JavaScript class checks now treat `Symbol.hasInstance` as an effectful
  host hook, while local VelarScript `is` checks remain inert.
- Module interfaces now preserve `export let` liveness separately from local
  assignment permission. Named live imports lose stale facts at effect
  boundaries, while namespace imports with live exports fail explicitly and
  all namespace fields remain read-only.
- Named calls now retain native callee-first evaluation, member receivers, and
  optional-call short-circuiting while still evaluating argument expressions
  once in source order before arranging them in declaration order.
- Membership expressions now evaluate their candidate before their collection,
  using a source-shaped controlled helper signature instead of reversing the
  operands during lowering.
- Plain member assignment no longer invents a getter read before its right-hand
  expression; host setter effects occur afterward, while compound assignment
  still models its required old-value read first.
- Assertion messages are checked only on the failing path with rejected
  condition facts; their effects no longer erase facts on the successful path.
- `List.reduce(callback, initial)` analysis now follows runtime argument order
  without losing contextual typing for an effect-free literal arrow callback.
- Optional indexes and calls now expose successful-chain facts to their deferred
  expressions, optional index calls continue safely, and optional function
  annotations contextually type assigned arrows.

Tooling and documentation changes:

- The formatter is syntax-aware and idempotent across Core, JSX, and Look.
- The language server diagnoses and repairs common JavaScript and Python
  spellings directly.
- README, reference documents, templates, real applications, and the
  VelarScript website use the same 0.10 contract.
- CI extracts and compiles documentation and website examples.

## 0.1 through 0.9 — Pre-release development

These development lines established the compiler, CLI, standard modules, Web
framework, package boundary, browser tests, Workbench integration contract, and
static deployment pipeline. Their experimental syntax is superseded by 0.10
and is intentionally not retained as compatibility surface. Detailed history
remains available in Git.
